# People I've met who I think would succeed at running a startup.

Recommendations have to be made with conviction. If they aren't, they're useless.
I feel uncomfortable lying, and if I'm not absolutely sure about someone, I'd rather not be asked for a recommendation. That's why I made this list—these are the most talented people I've worked with or crossed paths with, and I’d feel comfortable recommending them.

If someone isn't on this list, it doesn’t mean anything. I’m sure I’m missing great people, and I tend to lean toward technically skilled people. This is just my current take.
